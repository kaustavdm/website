Finally got some time to feel the excitement! I'll leave tonight for the [Mozilla Summit](http://summit.mozilla.org/)! Midnight flight from Kolkata to Kunming, then to Shanghai and then to San Francisco! The excitement is gradually peaking. A few more hours and I'll probably be brimming with it. So I thought about writing a few notes before I leave.<!-- more -->



## Rant alert



The Summit is supposed to be for privileged contributors to Mozilla, who have spent their time and effort (and probably money) to spread the cause of the Mozilla Foundation. When I was invited to the Summit in May, I hardly had any major contributions towards Mozilla. The invitation fuelled the desire in me to contribute and do something for the community. Since then, I have tried to provide all my free time to Mozilla, attending events, doing stuff for Mozilla India and contributing learning more about Mozilla WebDev projects.

The result is inspiring. It cured me of the depression I was suffering due to work overload and not getting even some time for myself. I managed to route it to Mozilla's cause and there was result in front of me -- community involvement and recognition.



## What I learnt



It is never to late to start. So even if you are not attending this Mozilla Summit, gear up yourself, put in some solid contributions and you may be coming in for the next Summit!

So here is me signing off. Off to a few days of fun and learning and enjoyment. Off to Mozilla Summit at Santa Clara!
