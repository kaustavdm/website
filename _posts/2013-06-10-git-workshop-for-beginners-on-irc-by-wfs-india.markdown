[WFS-India](http://www.wfs-india.org) will be organizing a workshop on Git on June 15, 2013. It will be hosted online through IRC at [#wfs-india](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=wfs-india) on [Freenode](http://www.freenode.net). The workshop is targeted to help women new to [FOSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) to learn the basics of Git, a powerful and flexible version control system.<!-- more -->

Participants will be given conceptual knowledge on version control systems in general, along with hands-on training on using Git for their daily needs. The workshop will also show them how they can use Github for contributing to FOSS projects. The workshop will also encourage participants to use Git for storing documentation or other non-software projects.

Those new to IRC can read up the [IRC tutorial at IRCHelp.org](http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/irctutorial.html).
