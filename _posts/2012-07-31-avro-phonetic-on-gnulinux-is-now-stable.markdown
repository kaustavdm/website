scim-avro has been replaced by ibus-avro, and that too pretty successfully. Bangla users on GNU/Linux can now install ibus-avro from the [ibus-avro](http://linux.omicronlab.com/) GitHub repo.

The present version supports intelligent word guessing as you type, one of the features that I missed on scim-avro. It works across LibreOffice/OpenOffice, Firefox and text editor, thanks to the stability of iBus.

Overall, a big round of congratulations to the Avro team for this lovely piece of work.

For details, check [iBus page at OmicronLab](http://linux.omicronlab.com).
