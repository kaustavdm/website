Things I did in the last 3 days:





  1. Read 3 articles [[1]](http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html) [[2]](http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-2.html) [[3]](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/J95-4004) bringing back memories of scraps of researches I used to do about 8 years back.


  2. Figured out those researches did have some real value.


  3. [Read up some more](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computational-linguistics/) about those topics.


  4. Figured out I was essentially suffocating due to lack of innovation.


  5. Started back on those researches.



Hello, computational linguistics!
