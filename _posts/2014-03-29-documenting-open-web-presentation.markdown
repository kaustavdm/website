I was supposed to give a talk at [Barcamp Bangalore Spring 2014](http://barcampbangalore.org/bcb/). It was a short presentation on the status of gathering information about web technologies and making them available publicly through resources like the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org) and [WebPlatform](http://webplatform.org).

The target audience for this presentation were supposed to be newcomers to the field, so the presentation talks of everything at a very basic level.
