## A tiny purple bug

`[June 24, 2021]`

A tiny purple bug drifted through space. It had nothing to do for a while.

The bug was on a planned trajectory it had set for itself while launching from the last planet it had spent a few weeks on. Or was it a few hours? Flow of time is not something a bug cares to notice. It knew the trajectory was safe, and so it had nothing to stay alert for.

All the bug did now was observe and wonder in awe at the purple clouds, swirls, and spirals that floated, bobbed, and bounced in a lighter purple background.

Everything was coloured in shades of purple in this universe, or that is at least how the bug saw it. Its vision was monochromatic, in this case keyed to purple. Purple is a nice colour to see in when you can see only one colour. It made the terrors that lie in the vastness of space, and the terror of the vastness of space itself, more palatable to a creature so insignificantly small.

_"With the right kind of limited perspective, the universe can be a beautiful place,"_ it thought in silence.
