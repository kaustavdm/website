          Technologist. Systems thinker. Doer. Almost author. Non-binary.

        <p itemprop="description">
          I work in the intersections of tech and non-tech. I code, I help others understand technology, I write and have recently started learning to play the Tabla and using chopsticks.
        </p>
        <p>
          In software engineering, my interests and experiences are in building resilient backend systems, even though I have worked on fullstack web applications. I am particularly interested in Go, Node.js and Rust.
