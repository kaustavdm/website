## Why record and stream these discussions?

**Deb:** We [Deb and Kaustav] have been discussing some interesting topics in the last few weeks. I want to keep a record of these discussions and create a time capsule of present day thoughts in the hope that it will be useful in the future, to the future-self or to anyone else stumbling across these records.

We have a tendency to imagine a future and then talk about it and then get excited about it and then doing something and then realise that the world has not caught up to it yet and it needs more time. By the time the world actually catches up with it, we are done with it, exhausted about it and bored about it, and we move on to something else.

These discussions are a way to sharpen my understanding of certain interest areas where you, Kaustav, might be able to help.

**Kaustav:** Content warning for viewers: These are thoughts we have chosen to record. These thoughts can be utterly specific at times and thus be very narrow, and sometimes be extremely generalist and so not apply to specific contexts. The peril for the viewer is in getting raw information as it processes and comes out of the brain.

I hope that being able to see these thoughts form will be helpful in the future. Like RPGs, hopefully this recording will allow the viewer to rewind these recorded thoughts and consider the effect of alternate actions and decisions to see if that change leads to a different outcome.

Work in progress...
